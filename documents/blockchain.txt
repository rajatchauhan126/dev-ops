Blockchain

--The three primary forms of bitcoin clients are: 1)Full Client. 2) Light Client - eg. Multibit. 3) Web Client.

--running distributed ledger systems.
--The most popular programming language used currently to write smart contracts is Solidity. Solidity is an object-oriented high-level programming language.
--keeping in mind the rules of the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM.

-high degree of trust for business transactions. 
-does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or
-settlement and validation of transactions. 
-called a “Proof-Of-Work” algorithm- to conduct a global “election” every 10 minutes, 

--A Solution To a Distributed Computing Problem

--A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows
you to search for addresses, transactions and blocks and see the relationships and flows
between them.
Popular blockchain explorers include:
• blockchain.info
• blockexplorer.com
• insight.bitpay.com
• blockr.io

---The destination key is called an encumbrance. 
Outputs from one transaction can be used as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating
a chain of ownership as the value is moved from address to address.

--types of transaction
	1. Common transaction.
	2. Aggregating transaction.
	3. Distributing transaction.
	
-- how a transaction becomes part of a new block and how the block is “mined”

--Bitcoin Mining
The transaction is now propagated on the bitcoin network. It does not become part of the shared ledger (the blockchain) until it is verified and included in a block by a process
called mining.

--The bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are bundled into
blocks, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only a small
amount of computation to verify as proven. This process is called mining and serves
two purposes in bitcoin:
	-Mining creates new bitcoins in each block, almost like a central bank printing new
money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is fixed and diminishes with time.
	- Mining creates trust by ensuring that transactions are only confirmed if enough
computational power was devoted to the block that contains them. More blocks
mean more computation which means more trust.

-- The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created
and stored by end-users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. 

--The public key can be then generated from the private key

--Elliptic Curve Cryptography
--Bitcoin addresses are almost always presented to users in an encoding called “Base58Check” 
--Public Key to Bitcoin Address

--Wallets
	--Non-Deterministic (Random) Wallets
	--Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets
	--Mnemonic Code Words - BIP0039 is used by the Trezor wallet and a few other wallets but is incompatible with Electrum’s implementation
	--Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP0032/BIP0044)
	--Paper Wallets

--coinbase transaction

--The bitcoin transaction script language, also named confusingly Script.
--Bitcoin’s scripting language is called a stack-based language because it uses a data structure called a stack. 

----The Bitcoin Network
--Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture -there are no “special” nodes and that all nodes share the burden of providing network services. 

--A bitcoin node is a collection of functions: routing, the blockchain database, mining, and wallet services. 

--Network Discovery

--Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Nodes
	--Not all nodes have the ability to store the full blockchain. 

--Bloom Filters
--Transaction Pools - Almost every node on the bitcoin network maintains a temporary list of unconfirmed transactions called the memory pool or transaction pool.

------------------------------------------The Blockchain----------------------------------------------
The blockchain data structure is an ordered back-linked list of blocks of transactions.

--Structure of a Block - A block is a container data structure that aggregates transactions for inclusion in the public ledger, the blockchain. 

--The block header is 80 bytes, whereas the average transaction is at least 250 bytes and the average block contains more than 500 transactions. 

--Block Header
	--The block header consists of three sets of block metadata.
		--First, there is a reference to a previous block hash,
		--timestamp and nonce.
		-- The third piece of metadata is the Merkle Tree root, a data structure used to efficiently summarize all the transactions in the block.


--block can thus be identified two ways, either by referencing the block hash, or by referencing the block height.

--The Genesis Block - The first block in the blockchain is called the genesis block and was created in 2009.
--Linking Blocks in the Blockchain

--Merkle Trees-A Merkle Tree, also known as a Binary Hash Tree is a data structure used for efficiently
summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle Trees are binary
trees containing cryptographic hashes.

--Mining and Consensus
	--Mining is the process by which new bitcoin is added to the money supply.
